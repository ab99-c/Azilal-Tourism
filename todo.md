## 9-Principles Professional Upgrade

- [x] Gate admin-only CRUD endpoints (cars/hotels create/update/delete, bookings.list) behind adminProcedure
- [x] Add DB indexes: cars.isActive, hotels.isActive, bookings.type/status, favorites unique(userId,itemType,itemId)
- [x] Add in-memory TTL cache for cars.list / hotels.list with invalidation on mutations
- [x] Harden bookings input validation (checkOut >= checkIn, length limits, guests >= 1)
- [x] Verify with vitest + build, save checkpoint, push to GitHub

## Bug Fixes (reported by user)

- [x] Fix navbar: removed duplicate contact link, improved spacing/whitespace-nowrap
- [x] Fix map pins: replaced fake coords with real Azilal-region coordinates, recentered map
- [x] Fix 3 broken destination imgs with concatenated Unsplash URLs

## Branding: ADRAR brand targeting Azilal city

- [x] Update hero badge/tagline to mention Azilal explicitly (ADRAR is the brand, Azilal is the city)
- [x] Update meta title/description to "ADRAR - Tourism in Azilal" framing
- [x] Update footer/about text to position ADRAR as the tourism brand of Azilal
- [x] Verify and checkpoint + push to GitHub

## Place name audit: ADRAR = brand, Azilal = place

- [x] Audit all text strings (LanguageContext, components) for ADRAR/ادرار used as place/region name
- [x] Replace place references with Azilal/أزيلال in all 4 languages (~63 occurrences)
- [x] Keep ADRAR only as brand (navbar logo, hero alt, footer brand, About ADRAR, EN/FR hero titles)
- [x] Verify visually, checkpoint (2013b0a6), push to GitHub (8ec4611)

## Navbar scroll navigation fix

- [x] Fix navbar links: clicking sections should smooth-scroll to the target section
- [x] Add JS scrollToSection utility with fixed-navbar offset (Navbar, Hero CTA/arrow, Footer links)
- [x] Fix broken concatenated image URL in CategoriesSection
- [x] Verify live (desktop + mobile viewport), checkpoint, push to GitHub

## User report: scroll fix not working on live site ("MATSLA7CH")

- [x] Test scrolling on live production (manus.space): real click on "الفنادق" scrolled to hotels section (3655px)
- [x] Add scrollIntoView fallback in scrollToSection when scrollTo does not move the page
- [x] Verify on production (checkpoint 8b381298, auto-published)
- [x] Push 8b381298 to GitHub (ab99-c/Azilal-Tourism main) — Vercel will auto-redeploy

## Stripe (deferred — user ineligible for Sandbox; will add keys later)

- [x] Investigated Stripe setup; user must supply own Stripe keys (not yet provided)

## Pay on Arrival payment system for bookings (user chose this)

- [x] Extend bookings schema: paymentMethod (pay_on_arrival) + paymentStatus columns (totalPrice persisted)
- [x] Server: persist paymentMethod + paymentStatus on booking create; admin markPaid/confirm procedures
- [x] Frontend: BookingModal 4-step flow with payment method step (Pay on Arrival) + total price preview
- [x] Frontend: booking confirmation screen explaining pay-directly-on-arrival
- [x] Owner dashboard: bookings tab with payment status + mark as paid action
- [x] Tests (vitest): booking.payment.test.ts + existing suites — 16/16 passing
- [x] Checkpoint + push to GitHub
